**1. Project title**

"Insights into aquatic warbler inbreeding and population genomics using whole-genome sequencing"

**2. Description**

The goal of the study was to explore inbreeding and genetic diversity in the threatened aquatic warbler (_Acrocephalus paludicola_) using whole-genome re-sequencing of samples from two Polish populations: the declining, moderately sized and isolated West Pomerania, sampled in 1999; and the large and stable Biebrza Valley, sampled in 1997 and 2018. DNA was sequenced with the Illumina Nova Seq X Plus Series instrument (PE 150). The pipeline was used to process the raw-sequences (archived at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERP181236) and run population analyses using containers and singularity. The aquatic warbler reference genome was used for mapping, bAcrPal2.2 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_965287075.1/). The pipeline was created by Dr Wiktor Kuśmirek (Warsaw University of Technology, Poland) and Dr Justyna Kubacka (Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciences).
